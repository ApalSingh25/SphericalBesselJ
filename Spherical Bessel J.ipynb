    "We would like to reconcile Rayleigh's formula for spherical Bessel functions of the first kind $j_n(z) = (-1)^nz^n\\left(\\frac{d}{zdz}\\right)^n\\frac{sinz}{z}$ with the recursive definition $j_n(z) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{z}}J_{n+\\frac{1}{2}}(z)$. Rayleigh's formula is uniquely determined but ambiguity arises in the recursive definition because of the term $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{z}}$, since the square root function is multivalued for negative real arguments. We find that this problem is resolved by taking the principal root of $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{z}}$. The same approach should be taken when computing spherical Bessel functions of the second kind."

    "Another observation we can make is that $j_n(z)$ has the same parity as $n$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$. One way to do so would be to use, say, sbesseljrecursive(n,z) to see $j_n(z) - j_n(-z) = 0$ for n even and $j_n(z) + j_n(-z) = 0$ for n odd. Another way is to use yet another definition of $j_n(z)$, the power series representation $${j}_{n}\\left(z\\right)=z^{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-\\frac{1}{2}z^{2})\n",
    "^{k}}{k!(2n+2k+1)!!}$$ from which the desired result follows immediately. By a similar analysis, we find that $y_n(z)$, the spherical Bessel function of the second kind, is odd for n even and even for n odd. Thus, the spherical Hankel function of the first kind $h_n^{(1)}(z) = j_n(z) + iy_n(z)$, as well as the spherical Hankel function of the second kind $h_n^{(2)}(z) = j_n(z) - iy_n(z)$, is conjugate symmetric (i.e. Hermitian) over the reals if and only if n is even.
